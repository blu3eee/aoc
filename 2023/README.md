# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) event. Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed programming challenges that follow a storyline. Each day in December up to the 25th, a new challenge is unlocked.

## Structure

Each day's challenge is placed in a separate directory, named `day01`, `day02`, etc. Every directory contains at least two files in the `src` folder: `main.rs` and `input.txt` which is the input provided by Advent of Code.

## Most interesting problems so far

- Day 2 part 2
- Day 3
- Day 5 part 2
- Day 7

## Acknowledgements

- Thanks to Eric Wastl, the creator of Advent of Code.
- Thanks to everyone who participates in the Advent of Code and shares their solutions and approaches.

### Happy coding and happy holidays!
